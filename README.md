# Find and Replace string Problem Statement

All the Code used and written in this repo are written by me using C# in Visual studio 2019.

# Problem Statement
The problem statement was to build a web api that contains the logic to find and replace certain words out of the string provided as input and returns the replaced string as a response.


# Approach
 Created an ASP.Net Web Application (.NET Framework) with Web API core reference which accepts a string as an input and then build the logic using C# to replace string values and return new replaced string as a response.

### Tool Used

* Visual Studio 2019
* C#
